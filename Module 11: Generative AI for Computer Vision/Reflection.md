### Module 11 Reflection
This module did not have an assignment but I have included my notes from the week's lecture below.
#### **Generative AI**: 
"A subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new data, such as images, videos, text, and music. It has evolved from simple models to complex systems that can produce highly realistic and creative outputs."
* Main Types of Generative Models:
  - Autoregressive Models (generate images pixel by pixel, conditioning on previous pixels)
  - Variational Autoencoders
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Diffusion Models
  - Transformers
  - State Space Models
* Generalist Models: trained on large-scale, diverse datasets covering multiple domains and modalities. Examples include BERT, GPT, CLIP.
* Foundation Models: Large-scale model mastering a specific domain. Examples include DALL-E, Stable Diffusion.
* Core concepts of GenAI:
  - Likelihood - Measures the probability of a given set of data being generated by a particular model.
  -  Latent Spaces - Vector representation of data that captures its underlying structure and essential features.
* Applications of Generative Models in CV:
  - Image Generation and Synthesis
  - Image-to-Image Translation
  - Image Inpainting
  - Super-Resolution
  - Representation Learning
  - Anomaly Detection
  - Data Augmentation
* Metrics for Generative Models:
  - Inception Score: Measures image generation quality via Inception networks
  - Frechet Inception Distance: Matches generated to real image distributions
  - Perceptual Metrics: Evaluates quality through neural networks.
  - Human Evaluation: Rates images subjectively
