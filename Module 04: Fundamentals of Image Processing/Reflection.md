### Module 04 Reflection
**Key Takeaways from the lecture**:
* *Basics of Image Processing* (enhancing and analyzing captured images):
  - Pixels are basic units of digital images. 
  - Understanding how computers see images, as a matrix of pixel values that can either be:
    - Grayscale: One gray channel, represented as a 2D matrix with pixel values ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white) indicating brightness.
    - Color: Three channels, red, green, and blue (RGB). Represented as a 3D matrix.
* *Digital Image Formats*:
  - JPEG - Lossy compression, widely used for photographs.
  - PNG - Lossless compression, supports transparency.
  - BMP - Uncompressed, large file size.
  - TIFF - flexible format, can be lossy or lossless.
* *Image Pre-processing basic operations*:
  - Image Enhancement: adjusting contrast, brightness, and noise reduction.
  - Image Restoration: Removing blurs and correcting distortions.
  - Image Segmentation: Diving and image into meaningful regions which includes techniques like:
    * Thresholding - converting grayscale images to binary by setting a threshold.
    * Edge Detection - Using algorithms like Canny or Sobel to find edges.
    * Clustering - Grouping pixels based on color or intensity.
  - Image Comprehension: Reducing the size of the image format.
* *Image Enhancing Techniques*:
  - Histogram Equalization: Improving the contrast of an image.
  - Smoothing: Reducing the noise using filters like Gaussian or Median.
  - Sharpening: Enhancing edges using techniques like Laplacian.

For group assignment A04, we were tasked with choosing an "Image Processing Adventure Quest" for which my group chose the Kingdom of Image Formats, Challenge 2: "Create a mock interview with characters representing each image format, discussing their strengths and weaknesses." My group researched different image formats like JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF and my contribution was to make the graphic for the mock interview. As a visual learner, I found being able to see and read the strengths and weaknesses of different image formats as fun characters to be a rather enjoyable way to learn.
