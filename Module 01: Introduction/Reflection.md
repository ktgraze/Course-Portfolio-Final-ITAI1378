### Module 01 Reflection
**Module 01** served as a great introduction to Computer Vision and the history of this sub-field of AI. 
In the process of researching for our group assignment I stumbled across an invaluable resource - the website [Turing Post](https://www.turingpost.com/p/cvhistory2), 
which has several comprehensive posts on the history of CV, from Frank Roseblatt's *Perceptron* (pictured below), modeled after a biological neuron to Ray Kurzweil's 1974 invention, the first commercial Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system, which printed written text into spoken words.
