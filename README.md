# Course Portfolio - *ITAI 1378: Intro to Computer Vision* - Katherine Stanton
This repository is intended to serve as an organized and extensive collection of the entirety of my work for the 2024 Fall semester. This repository is organized by module, with a folder for each. All group assignments and individual labs are in their respective module folders. The Course Portfolio PowerPoint has its own separate folder and highlights the key aspects of my learning journey in this course along with resources I found most useful.
