# Course Portfolio - *ITAI 1378: Intro to Computer Vision* - Katherine Stanton
This repository is intended to serve as an organized and extensive collection of the entirety of my work for the 2024 Fall semester. This repository is organized by module, with a folder for each. All group assignments, individual labs, and reflections are in their respective module folders. The Course Portfolio PowerPoint has its own separate folder and highlights the key aspects of my learning journey in this course along with resources I found most useful.

Over the semester we covered the history of Computer Vision, common tools used in CV, the inner-workings of cameras, sensors, Image Processing, Machine Learning in CV, and went in depth into Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. I leave this course having been introduced to working with new libraries like TensorFlow and frameworks like Keras, more familiar with various CV algorithms and common ML models used in the field. I also feel much more comfortable using GitHub and working collaboratively while using the site.
