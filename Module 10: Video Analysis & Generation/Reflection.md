### Module 10 Reflection
Though we did not have an assignment for this week, these are my key takeaways from the module's lecture:
#### Video Fundamentals:
* Frame Rate - the number of still images (frames) per second.
* Resolution - the number of pixels in each frame.
* Color Space - RGB (additive color model used for displays) and YUV (separates brightness and color- common in video transmission)
* Compression
  - Lossy, small file size, some quality loss.
  - Lossless, larger files, perfect quality.
* Video Formats- Containers for video, audio, and metadata like MP4, AVI, MOV.
#### Video Processing:
* Video manipulation, frame-by-frame, stabilization, and enhancements like improving sharpness and contrast.
#### Core pre-processing techniques:
* Frame Extraction: Breaking video down into individual images
* Resizing/ cropping: Ensuring consisten model input sizes
* Color Space Conversion: Aligning with model requirements
* Normalization: Adjusting pixel values for faster learning.
#### Video Segmentation & Scene Understanding
* Background Subtraction
* Semantic Segmentation
* Scene Classification
### Video Summarization and Retrieval
* Key Frame Extraction: Picking the most representative frames.
* Summarization Techniques: Creating condensed versions of videos.
* Video Indexing and Retrieval: Search for videos based on content.
