### Module 12 Reflection
Again, we did not have an assignment for this module, but I have included my lecture notes.
#### Autonomous Systems for CV
* Intelligent Agents - systems that sense, think, and act in their environment. Examples include virtual assistants, self-driving cars, and factory robots.
* Agent Types:
  - Reactive: Respond quickly to stimuli.
  - Deliberative: Plan actions toward goals.
  - Hybrid: Combine the best of both.
* Computer Vision and agents: Enpowers agents to see and understand the world through technology like object recognition, scene understanding, and tracking.
  - Real world applications include:
    * Robotics - Object recognition, obstacle avoidance, grasping.
    * Self-driving cars - Road detection, navigation, pedestrian and vehicle detection.
    * Medical Imaging - Detecting abnormalities for diagnosis.
    * Security and Surveillance - Recognizing faces, tracking suspicious activity.
* Reinforcement Learning: Agents learn by trial and error, guided by rewards.
